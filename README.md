# cs48-project-spaceblasters
Source code repo for Space Blasters game (CS48 project)
 
Running Instructions:
* Go to the root directory of the project repo and execute
  the command "ant run".
* Alternative: Run the executable jar provided with the project
  repo to run the game without using ant.

SIDE NOTE

* Ant test command does not work. We did all of our unit testing 
  in IntelliJ IDE and all the tests passed. The test files can be
  found in the project repo.
